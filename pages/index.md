# This is a website for us to post life updates or interesting things I find that I want to post about. It's also a online resource for things that I like to have handy: cool websites, important photos I like and can show off to friends, my resume, etc. I'll make posts from time to time that adds stuff like that.


##TODO:

1. Rework the header a little bit:
    Rework Blog tab:
        Remove current Blog route for now
        Turn the Blog header item into a dropdown for Categorie, Tags, and Archive
        Remove Archive
    Add a Gallery item that will contain all the pictures in a new assets/post-photos directory
    Add the Resume item in the About dropdown
    Add a Resources item which links to a new Resources page that contains interesting resources based on what the user might be interested in. Could maybe include a Changelog or something too

2. Add some polish all over the place
3. Fix theme issues when I find them
