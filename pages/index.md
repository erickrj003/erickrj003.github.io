## Hey there, I'm Erick.

This site serves as both a personal journal and a platform to connect with others who share our interests in technology, faith, and global missions. Here you'll find:

- **Blog Posts** on a bunch of topics that I find interesting
- **Ministry Updates** and theological thoughts
- **Professional Information** about my work background and resume

Feel free to explore using the navigation above. You can browse posts by category, search for specific topics, or simply start with the most recent updates.
