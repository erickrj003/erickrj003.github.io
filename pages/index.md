# This is a website for us to post life updates or interesting things i find that I want to post about.

## To get started, click the Blog tab. You can search for blog titles under the sidebar on the right. Thanks for checking us out!

##TODO:

1. Rework the header a little bit:
    Rework Blog tab:
        Remove current Blog route
        Turn the Blog header item into a dropdown for Categorie, Tags, and Archive
        Remove Archive
    Add a Gallery item that will contain all the pictures in a new assets/post-photos directory
    Add the Resume item in the About dropdown
    Add a Resources item which links to a new Resources page that contains interesting resources based on what the user might be interested in. Could maybe include a Changelog or something too

2. Add some polish all over the place
3. Fix theme issues when I find them
