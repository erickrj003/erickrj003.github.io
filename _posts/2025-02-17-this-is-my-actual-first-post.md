Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! My name is Erick Johnson, and if you want to read about me for some reason then you've come to the right place.

## A Little About Me
On October 12, 2024, I married the love of my life, Stella. Together, we’ve made our home in Aurora, IL  living out the Great Adventure. Stella makes all of life worth so much more! Plus, without her, I'd have nobody to (purposely) lose to in Mario Kart on a regular basis.

## What I Love
I’m a man of many interests, and I’m passionate about using my skills and hobbies to make a positive impact in the world. Here are a few things that I anjoy doing:

* Software Development: I love solving problems and creating solutions through code. Whether it’s building full-stack applications, automating tasks, or learning new technologies, software development is both a career and a creative outlet for me.

* Teaching: I'd say I'm a guy who knows a little bit about a lot of things. I've taught high school programming, competitive marching band, Bible studies, wrestling class, and probably other things too.

* Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: Currently, I am a BJJ blue belt and technically a Judo green belt, but I've been grappling for many years. I teach a wrestling class at my local gym, and have coached at the high school level.

* Music: Ever since high school, music has always been a big part of my life. To me, it's all the proof I need that God is real and loves us deeply. I'm a euphonium player primarily and loved marching for the Madison Scouts and Boston Crusaders back in the day.

## My Greatest Passion

Above all else, my life is dedicated to worshiping my Lord Jesus Christ. My faith is the foundation of everything I do, and my greatest passion is fulfilling the Great Commission by proclaiming the Gospel among the world’s most unreached places. I believe that every person deserves the opportunity to hear the good news of Jesus Christ, and I’m committed to playing my part in making that happen.

#### Why This Blog?

This blog is a space for me to share my journey, insights, and experiences. Whether it’s a reflection on faith, a tutorial on software topics, or a story from my travels, my hope is that this blog will inspire, educate, and encourage you. Most importantly, I want to glorify God in everything I do and point others to Him.
