# Welcome!

This is just a simple website I wanted to make to take advantage of the free GitHub Pages hosting option. I'd like to use it as a resource for myself, friends, colleagues and students for various things while also being a place to show off my front end design skills. 

This static page is generated by Jekyll. Big thanks to zhonger for creating the H20-ac theme which this is based on. Thanks for checking it out!
