## The Johnsons

On October 12, 2024, I married my college trombone buddy, Stella. We are Olivet Nazarene University grads ('21 and '22). At the moment, we live and work in Aurora, IL, living out God's great adventure by saying yes to whatever the Lord has for us.

## What Can We Do For You?

**Software Development:**  
You can check out the Resume tab to get an idea of what languages, frameworks, and concepts I'm familiar with, but I'm always happy to learn new things and work on worthwhile projects! Just shoot me an email and I'll get back to you ASAP.

**Teaching:**  
- I am a professional computer science teacher at the K-12 levels. I teach basic computer skills, basic IT skills, and introductory to advanced programming for high school and college students.  
- My extracurricular teaching background includes youth and high school wrestling, youth and adult BJJ, and high school and collegiate marching band. If you're looking for a teacher, coach, drill writer, or tech, please reach out!  
- Stella has been a professional band director for various grade levels for over 3 years. She has done private lessons, developed programs from scratch, and is highly regarded by her peers in every workspace she participates in. Email her at [smbarrera987@gmail.com](mailto:smbarrera987@gmail.com)!

## A Global Commission

Above all else, my life is dedicated to worshiping my Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord has called all of us to join Him in fulfilling His Great Commission (Matthew 28:16-20). Sharing the Gospel to every tribe and tongue is not a suggestionâ€”it's for all believers!

Ultimately, this space is for us to share our journey, insights, and experiences. Most importantly, our prayer is to glorify God in everything we say and do.
